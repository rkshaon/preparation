# Software Engineer Guideline

## Fundamentals
Fundamentals are language independent.
- Data structures
    - Arrays: Contiguous memory storage for elements of the same type.
    - Linked Lists: Nodes connected by pointers, allowing dynamic insertion and deletion.
    - Stacks and Queues: Abstract data types for managing elements (LIFO for stacks, FIFO for queues).
    - Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, etc.): Hierarchical structures with nodes and edges.
    - Graphs: Represent relationships between entities.
    - Hash Tables: Key-value pairs with fast access.
- Algorithms
    - Sorting Algorithms: Bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort, etc.
    - Searching Algorithms: Binary search, linear search, depth-first search, breadth-first search.
    - Dynamic Programming: Solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.
    - Greedy Algorithms: Making locally optimal choices at each step.
    - Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, etc.
- Parallelization/concurrency
    - Understand how to write concurrent and parallel programs:
        - Threads and Processes: Differences, synchronization, and communication.
        - Locks and Semaphores: Ensuring thread safety.
        - Parallel Programming Models: OpenMP, CUDA, etc.
- Object Oriented Paradigms
    - Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
    - Understand design principles like SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
- Design patterns
    - Familiarize yourself with common design patterns:
        - Creational Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Builder, etc.
        - Structural Patterns: Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, etc.
        - Behavioral Patterns: Observer, Strategy, Command, etc. 
- Operating systems
    - Basics of OS concepts
        - Processes and Threads: Creation, scheduling, synchronization.
        - Memory Management: Paging, segmentation, virtual memory.
        - File Systems: File I/O, directory structures.
        - Deadlocks and Race Conditions.
    - OS
        - Linux
        - Windows
        - MacOS
- Scheduling
    - CPU scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, SJF, Round Robin).
    - Real-time scheduling.
- Authentication/security
    - Understand authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT, etc.).
    - Learn about encryption, hashing, and secure communication.
- REST best practices
    - Design RESTful APIs following best practices (resource naming, HTTP methods, status codes).
    - Understand HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State).
- Databases
    - Relational databases (SQL) vs. NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis, etc.).
    - Indexing, normalization, ACID properties.
- Architecture 
    - Microservices vs. monolithic architecture.
    - REST vs. gRPC
    - Scalability, load balancing, caching.
- System designs
    - Understanding how to design scalable, reliable, and efficient systems is crucial. Learn about distributed systems, microservices architecture, load balancing, and caching strategies.
    - Explore concepts like CAP theorem, sharding, and consistency models. 
- Testing and Quality Assurance
    - Familiarize yourself with different testing techniques: unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
    - Understand code coverage, test-driven development (TDD), and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Version Control
    - Git is essential for collaboration and version control.
    - Learn about branching strategies, merging, rebasing, and resolving conflicts.
- Cloud Services and Deployment
    - Explore cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
    - Understand how to deploy applications, manage containers (Docker/Kubernetes), and set up serverless functions.
- Soft Skills
    - Communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills are equally important.
    - Practice explaining technical concepts clearly and concisely.
