# Tuple
<!-- https://realpython.com/python-tuple/ -->
A `tuple` is a built-in data type that allows to create immutable sequences of values. The values or items in a tuple can be of any type. `Tuples` are sequences of objects. They’re commonly called `containers` or `collections` because a single tuple can contain or collect an arbitrary number of other objects.

## Characteristics of `Tuple` objects
- `Ordered`: They contain elements that are sequentially arranged according to their specific insertion order.
- `Lightweight`: They consume relatively small amounts of memory compared to other sequences like lists.
- `Indexable through a zero-based index`: Indexing start from zero.
- `Immutable`: They don’t support in-place mutations or changes to their contained elements. They don’t support growing or shrinking operations.
- `Heterogeneous`: They can store objects of different data types and domains, including mutable objects.
- `Nestable`: They can contain other tuples, so you can have tuples of tuples.
- `Iterable`: They support iteration, so traverse them using a loop or comprehension while performing operations with each of their elements.
- `Sliceable`: They support slicing operations, meaning that you can extract a series of elements from a tuple.
- `Combinable`: They support concatenation operations.
- `Hashable`: They can work as keys in dictionaries when all the tuple items are immutable.
