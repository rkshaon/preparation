# Generator Expressions in Python

## What is generator expressions?
- Generator expressions are a concise way to create iterators in Python.
- They look similar to list comprehensions, but instead of creating a list that holds all the elements at once, they generate elements on demand.

## Syntax
```
generator_expression = (expression for item in iterable if condition)
```
- `expression`: This defines what value will be produced for each item in the iterable.
- `item in iterable`: This iterates over the elements in the sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).
- `if condition (optional)`: This allows you to filter elements based on a condition.

### Example
```
numbers = range(1, 11)
multiply_numbers = (n*10 for n in numbers)

for n in multiply_numbers:
    print(n)    # Output: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
```
- The expression `n * 10` calculates the multiplied value of each item (`n`) in the list `numbers` sequence.
- No condition applied.
- The entire expression creates an iterator (`multiply_numbers`) that generates numbers on demand when used in a loop.
```
numbers = range(1, 11)
squares = (x * x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0)

for num in squares:
  print(num)  # Output: 4 16 36 64 100
```
- The expression `x * x` calculates the square of each item (x) in the list `numbers` sequence.
- The if `x % 2 == 0` condition filters for even numbers only.
- The entire expression creates an iterator (`squares`) that generates the `squares` of even numbers on demand when used in a loop.

## Benefits
- `Memory Efficiency`: Generator expressions are memory-efficient because they don't store all elements at once like lists. This is particularly useful for large datasets.
- `Readability`: They can improve code readability by providing a concise way to create iterators within expressions.
- `Performance`: For certain operations, they can be more performant than traditional loops due to the on-demand generation.
- Generator expressions can be used for various tasks like filtering, transforming, or creating infinite sequences.
- You can use them with different iterables like strings or custom iterators.

## Test
#### 1. Write a generator expression to create a list of all uppercase letters in a string.
```
text = """
In the 16th century, an age of great marine and terrestrial exploration, 
Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. As 
a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became 
involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the kingâ€™s 
favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he 
offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.
"""

result = (t for t in text if t.isupper())

for r in result:
    print(r)
```

#### 2. Generate an iterator that produces the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number.
```
def fibonacci_generator(n):
  """
  Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number `n`.

  Args:
      n: The maximum value in the sequence (exclusive).

  Yields:
      Each subsequent Fibonacci number in the sequence.
  """
  a, b = 0, 1

  for _ in range(n):
    yield a
    a, b = b, a + b


limit = 10
fibonacci_sequence = fibonacci_generator(limit)

for num in fibonacci_sequence:
  print(num)  # Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

#### 3. Filter a list of numbers and keep only those divisible by 3.
```
numbers = range(1, 101)
results = (n for n in numbers if n%3==0)

for r in results:
    print(r)
```
