# DRF View: APIView

The base class for all DRF views. Provides complete control over request handling and response generation.

## Example
```
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status

class ExampleAPIView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        data = {"message": "Hello, World!"}
        return Response(data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

    def post(self, request):
        return Response(request.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
```python

## Use Case
- When you need complete control over request/response handling.
- When you want to implement custom logic beyond standard CRUD operations.

## Where to Use
- Use for endpoints requiring custom logic that involves querysets and serializers.

## Where Not to Use
- Avoid for extremely custom endpoints with no need for queryset/serializer handling.
