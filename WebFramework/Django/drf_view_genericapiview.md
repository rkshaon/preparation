# GenericAPIView
A more flexible view that adds queryset and serializer handling. Forms the basis for many DRF generic views.

## Example
```python
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from myapp.models import MyModel
from myapp.serializers import MyModelSerializer

class ExampleGenericAPIView(GenericAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer

    def get(self, request):
        serializer = self.get_serializer(self.get_queryset(), many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
```

## Use Case
- When you need to customize behavior but still want the convenience of DRFâ€™s query/serializer handling.

## Where to Use
- Use for endpoints requiring custom logic that involves querysets and serializers.

## Where Not to Use
- Avoid for extremely custom endpoints with no need for queryset/serializer handling.
