# Architectural Patterns
Architectural patterns are higher-level strategies that concern the overall structure and organization of a software system. They provide a blueprint for system-level architecture.

## Scope
- Focus on solving problems related to the architecture of an entire application or system.
- Operate at a higher level of abstraction, dealing with the structure, interactions, and relationships between major components or subsystems.
- Architectural patterns deal with the overall structure and high-level organization of software systems.
- Architectural patterns are applied to the whole application or system.
- Architectural patterns provide strategies for managing and structuring the system as a whole.

## Architectural Patterns
- Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
- Client-Server Architecture
- Microservices Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Serverless Architecture
- Service Mesh
- Microkernel Architecture
- Space-Based Architecture
- Peer-to-Peer Architecture
- Pipe-and-Filter Architecture
- Broker Architecture
- Twelve-Factor App
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
