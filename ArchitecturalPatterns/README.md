# Architectural Patterns
Architectural patterns are higher-level strategies that concern the overall structure and organization of a software system. They provide a blueprint for system-level architecture.

## Scope
- Focus on solving problems related to the architecture of an entire application or system.
- Operate at a higher level of abstraction, dealing with the structure, interactions, and relationships between major components or subsystems.
