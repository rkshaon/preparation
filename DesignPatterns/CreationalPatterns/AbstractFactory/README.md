# Abstrct Factory
Abstract Factory Method is a [Creational Design pattern](./../../CreationalPatterns/README.md) that allows you to produce the families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. Using the abstract factory method, we have the easiest ways to produce a similar type of many objects. 

It provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories. Basically, here we try to abstract the creation of the objects depending on the logic, business, platform choice, etc.
