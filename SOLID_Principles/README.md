# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable code. 

SOLID principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns."

Each letter in the SOLID acronym stands for a different principle
