# Set
A `Set` is a built-in data type that is unordered collection of `unique` data.

## Characteristics of `Set`
- `Uniqueness`: A set can only contain unique values. If you try to add duplicate elements, they will be ignored.
- `Unordered`: Unlike lists and tuples, sets do not maintain the order of elements. The items in a set can appear in a different order every time you use them, and you cannot refer to them by index or key.
- `Unchangeable`: Once a set is created, you cannot change its items. However, you can remove items and add new ones.
