# Dunder / Magic Methods
Dunder (double underscore) methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods that Python classes can implement to emulate the behavior of built-in types and operations. These methods allow you to define how objects of your class behave with respect to various operations, such as arithmetic, comparison, and built-in functions.
